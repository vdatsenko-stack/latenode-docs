## ðŸ“¦ Platform Updates

- **Billing & Credit Statistics**  
  - Updated visualization of Plug & Play credits: now shows breakdown per scenario (RAG, Copilot, Connection) instead of a single *extra* category.  
  - Improved UI for scenario list and spending histograms.  

- **Reasoning Tools**  
  - Introduced **Think Tool**, which forces the model to reason between tool calls. Significantly improved accuracy (7/8 successful runs vs 0/8 without it).  
  - Introduced **Plan Tool**, which generates a reasoning plan before execution. Speeds up processing and reduces token consumption.  

- **Multimodal Mode**  
  - New file upload mode: in addition to text chunks, images are preserved and automatically described with captions.  
  - Multimodal queries supported: LLM can now process both text and images, answering questions about diagrams and visuals.  
  - Added **Custom LLM Connections** (connect external models via OpenRouter, with model selection at the connection level).  

- **Other Improvements**  
  - Memory optimizations in the engine.  
  - Faster triggers with reduced latency.   
  - Backend groundwork for role-based access control when sharing spaces.
