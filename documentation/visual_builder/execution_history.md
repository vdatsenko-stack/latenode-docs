ðŸ’¡ If the history table is empty, you need to run the scenario. For more details on running a scenario once, see the [Run once Scenario Execution](#broken-link-was-here) section.

Every scenario run (successful or unsuccessful) is recorded in the history. The history table is accessible by clicking the **History** button. The table displays key information about the scenario:

- **(3)** Execution **status** of the scenario:  

**Success** if the scenario is fully completed  
**Error** if errors occurred during the scenario  
**Paused** if the scenario is in the execution stage of a Wait node  
**New** if the scenario was stopped by clicking the **Stop** button  

- **(4)** Scenario execution **duration** in seconds;  
- **(5)** Number of **credits** consumed by the scenario;
