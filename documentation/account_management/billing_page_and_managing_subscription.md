## Billing Page

When a paid plan or trial is active, the **Billing** section becomes available in your account's left menu. On this page, you can see your current plan, the number of available credits, a **Manage payments** button, and tabs for **Extra Credits**, **Boosts**, and **Plug&Play Tokens**.

Below, you’ll find all available plans: **Micro**, **Starter**, **Grow**, and **Prime**. Each plan card displays:

- The number of included credits
- Limits on scenarios, flows, triggers, etc.
- A button to start a trial or activate the plan (if not activated before)

The current balance is also always visible in the left menu on any Latenode page:
