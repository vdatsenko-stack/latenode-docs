## Overview

In advanced scenarios, you can use multiple AI Agents to handle different domains of knowledge or task types. Each agent has its own instructions and set of tools - enabling modular, scalable workflows.

This setup improves clarity, separates responsibilities, and allows for more focused instruction design.

### When to Use

Use multiple AI agents when:

- Your workflow spans **distinct areas** like weather, finance, or general web lookup
- You want to **keep agent logic focused** (no bloated all-in-one prompts)
- You need **modular agents** that are easier to test, reuse, or extend
- Different agents require **different tools, models, or language settings**

### Agent Roles in This Example

| Agent | Task |
| --- | --- |
| `main_agent` | Parses the user input and routes to the right sub-agent |
| `finance_agent` | Handles currency conversion and crypto price checks |
| `weather_agent` | Handles weather summaries and current condition lookups |

Each sub-agent is connected only to tools relevant to its domain (e.g., `finance_agent` → `currency_converter`, `crypto_price_checker`).

---

### Tool Isolation

Keep each agent connected to only what it needs.

- `weather_agent` → `quick_weather_summary`, `current_weather_via_coordinates`
- `finance_agent` → `currency_converter`, `crypto_price_checker`
- `web_search_tool` is accessible globally or from `main_agent`

This way the main agent acts like a dispatcher, and the sub-agents remain focused.

---

### Routing Between Agents

The `main_agent` can detect intent from the message itself and trigger the right branch of logic.

### Best Practices

- Assign a clear responsibility to each agent
- Keep agent prompts short and purpose-specific
- Use tool descriptions and names that match their role
- Let the main agent **route and orchestrate**, not perform everything
- Test sub-agents independently
