Latenode's **AI Agent** is flexible enough to support multiple architectures: from a single dynamic assistant to modular multi-agent systems and external knowledge integration.

---

## 1. AI Agent Basic Workflow Example

A single AI Agent receives user prompts and decides which tools to use, if any. This setup is lightweight but powerful — capable of parsing, routing, and composing responses dynamically.

### Scenario Structure

![brave_ox4ExaprKc.png](./brave_ox4ExaprKc.png)

- One central `AI Agent`
- Connected to:
    - `weather_tool` (e.g. wttr.in)
    - `exchangerate_tool` (e.g. exchangerate.host)
    - `web_search_tool` (e.g. factual search)
- Input from `Trigger`, output to `SetVariables`

---

### Call Example 1 — Weather + Currency

**Prompt:**

> “What’s the weather in Berlin and how much is 100 EUR in USD?”
> 
- The agent triggers:
    - `weather_tool` with the city "Berlin"
    - `exchangerate_tool` for EUR to USD
- Skips unrelated tools

![brave_pVlu6L7Qpm.png](./brave_pVlu6L7Qpm.png)

**Expected output:**

```
It's currently 17°C in Berlin. 100 EUR is about 108 USD.
```

---

### Call Example 2 — Simple Fact

**Prompt:**

> “Who is the CEO of Apple?”
> 
- Agent skips weather and currency
- Only triggers `web_search_tool`

![brave_WHvrQ9Gm7U.png](./brave_WHvrQ9Gm7U.png)

**Expected output:**

```
The CEO of Apple is Tim Cook.
```

🎯 This scenario is great for lightweight assistants that respond contextually without complex logic trees.

## 2. Multiagent - AI Multi-Agent Interaction Example

This approach uses a **main agent** to break down user requests and forward sub-tasks to specialized agents. Each sub-agent operates independently and can have its own API logic.

### Scenario Structure

![brave_YsvXfPjJun.png](./brave_YsvXfPjJun.png)

- `main_agent` controls the overall logic
- Delegates to:
    - `weather_agent`
    - `finance_agent`
    - `web_search_tool`
- Each sub-agent is connected to dedicated APIs or logic blocks

---

### Call Example 1 — Weather + BTC

**Prompt:**

> “What’s the weather in Tokyo and what’s the BTC price?”
> 
- `main_agent` sends:
    - Weather part → `weather_agent`
    - Bitcoin price part → `finance_agent`
    
    ![brave_Jx7QglHbem.png](./brave_Jx7QglHbem.png)
    

**Expected output:**

```
The current weather in Tokyo is 27°C and sunny. The current price of Bitcoin (BTC) is $119,218 USD.
```

---

### Call Example 2 — CEO + HQ Weather

**Prompt:**

> “Who is the CEO of Apple and what’s the weather like at their HQ?”
> 
- Agent parses:
    - Apple HQ location → via `web_search_tool`
    - Weather in that location → via `weather_agent`
    
    ![brave_DWImZg8xtM.png](./brave_DWImZg8xtM.png)
    

**Expected output:**

```
The CEO of Apple is Tim Cook. He has held this position since August 2011, succeeding Steve Jobs.

As for the weather at Apple’s headquarters in Cupertino, California, it is currently 27°C and sunny.
```

🧩 This pattern fits well for scalable assistants, where logic needs to be cleanly split.

## 3. AI Agent with Cloudflare AutoRAG Database

---

Integrate an AI Agent with [Cloudflare AutoRAG](https://developers.cloudflare.com/autorag/usage/rest-api/) to retrieve structured external knowledge — such as product documentation, policies, or internal data.

### Scenario Structure

![brave_hY65yK91HG.png](./brave_hY65yK91HG.png)

- `cloudflare_rag_agent` handles free-form prompts
- Two HTTP tools connected:
    - `rag_database_docs` — deep semantic retrieval
    - `raw_data` — fast, factual lookups

> ⚠️ Before using this scenario, you must:
> 
> - [Create an account](https://developers.cloudflare.com/autorag/get-started/) on Cloudflare AutoRAG
> - Create a **database instance**
> - Upload your own documents via the dashboard or API
> - **Replace all placeholders** (`YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID`, `YOUR_RAG_ID`, `YOUR_API_TOKEN`) in the scenario’s HTTP request blocks with your actual values from the Cloudflare dashboard

> ✅ Most modern RAG platforms - including AutoRAG - automatically generate embeddings server-side. You don’t need to preprocess documents or manage vectors manually.
> 

---

### Call Example 1 — Documentation Question

**Prompt:**

> “How does the billing system of Cloudflare work?”
> 
- Agent detects it’s a high-level question
- Selects `rag_database_docs` to retrieve semantic context
- Responds based on indexed content

![brave_56vDQEGkPX.png](./brave_56vDQEGkPX.png)

**Expected output:**

```
Cloudflare's billing system uses a monthly subscription model with pro-rated charges...
```

---

### Call Example 2 — Quick Data Point

**Prompt:**

> “What’s the max bandwidth on the free Cloudflare plan?”
> 
- The agent determines it's a factual request
- Selects `raw_data` for direct value retrieval

![brave_4BqRRY4SOk.png](./brave_4BqRRY4SOk.png)

**Expected output:**

```
The free Cloudflare plan includes up to 1 TB of monthly bandwidth.
```

📘 Use AutoRAG-style integrations for assistants that can reason over your documents and give context-aware, accurate replies — without hosting your own vector database or embeddings pipeline.

## Best Practices

- Name all nodes descriptively — they become visible "tools" to the agent
- Use `Agent ID` to maintain session-based memory
- Set `Max Iterations` to prevent loops
- Use `Output JSON Schema` if the response needs to be structured
