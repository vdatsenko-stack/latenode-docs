# How to Get Support

We’re a small but passionate team doing our best to provide you with maximum value at a fair price.  

There may be more of you than there are of us — and that’s exactly what inspires us. It means we’re building something that truly matters. 💛  

While we strive to respond quickly, we may not always be able to reply immediately on a free support plan.  

Please be patient — we’ll always get back to you as soon as we can.  

To help you get answers quickly and keep moving forward, we’ve put together all available support options below:

##  Free Support Options

### Option #1: Documentation and AI Assistant (self-service)
Use the built-in search in our docs — we regularly update it with solutions to common questions.  

Our **AI assistant** is available 24/7 inside the platform. It can help with errors, explain features, and connect you to a live agent if needed.

### Option #2: Ask in the Latenode Community Forum
The [**Latenode Community Forum**](https://community.latenode.com) is our primary support channel.  

You can post questions, report issues, and share feedback publicly.  

We actively monitor the forum, and it’s the fastest way to get a response — both from our team and the wider community.  

By asking questions there, you also help others facing similar challenges.

### Option #3: Discord Community
Our secondary channel for real-time conversations, quick questions, and idea-sharing.  

It’s informal and great for live discussions with both our team and other users.
