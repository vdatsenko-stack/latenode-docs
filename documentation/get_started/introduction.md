# Latenode Overview

Latenode helps you automate processes with flexible no-code and low-code scenarios. The platform combines the simplicity of a visual editor with the power of code where it’s truly needed. This makes Latenode a great fit both for non-technical professionals and for developers who value speed and flexibility.

This guide will walk you through the basics of automation and show how Latenode can take repetitive work off your plate.

## What is a scenario?

A scenario is a sequence of steps you take to achieve a result. For example, imagine you are a marketer working with leads:

- Receive a lead from a website form or CRM  
- Verify the lead’s data  
- Send a welcome email  
- Create a task for a manager  
- If needed, sync data with other services  

Even a simple process like this can take a lot of time and requires switching between tools. Latenode helps you automate these steps — from routine actions to complex logic integration.

Automation is not only about technology, but also about mindset. Starting with basic scenarios and ready-made templates, you will gradually discover more and more processes that can be automated.
