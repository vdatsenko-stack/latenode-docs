### Purpose

AI Data Storage (RAG) is a component of the Latenode platform designed for storing and indexing text files, images, and other knowledge sources.

> ðŸ§  This tool is primarily intended to be used in conjunction with the AI Agent â€” it provides documents in the form of chunks, which the agent can then use to generate responses.
> 

Use cases include:

- Uploading and storing structured or unstructured content
- Generating embedding vectors for fast semantic search
- Running natural language search queries
- Connecting to the **RAG Search** node inside a scenario

---

### How to Access

You can access this feature via **Data Storage â†’ AI Data Storage (RAG)** in the left-hand side menu.

### What are Chunk Size and Overlap?

- **Chunk Size** â€” the number of tokens in a single chunk. Smaller chunks provide higher accuracy but increase the total number of chunks.
- **Chunk Overlap** â€” the percentage of token overlap between neighboring chunks. Helps maintain context across them.

### Managing Storage

Created storages are displayed in a table:
