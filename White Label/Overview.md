## Overview

Latenode can be embedded into your frontend and styled to look like part of your application.

In general, embedding Latenode consists of three stages:

1. Getting to know with the [admin panel](https://www.notion.so/Administration-1eb57d45a06780a89975e7b31bfe0312?pvs=21)
2. [Installing the embedded SDK](https://www.notion.so/Installing-the-embedded-SDK-1b657d45a06780a8af8bca11990b981c?pvs=21) into your application
3. [Authentication](https://www.notion.so/User-Authorization-1f957d45a06780e3b21ad4867360364f?pvs=21) of users through your existing authentication system (so they don't need a separate Latenode login)

Latenode is embedded in your application as an iframe, and users who are already logged into your platform get all the benefits of the system as if it were a native part of your application.
