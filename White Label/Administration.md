This article describes the user authorization process for your organization and capabilities of the administrator panel within the Latenode platform.

## Requirements

To follow the steps described below, you must already have a White Label administrator account on the Latenode platform, as well as a secret key for signing JWT tokens.

## Creating Custom Subscription Plans

Before you begin authorizing users from your organization within the Latenode platform, you need to create at least one subscription plan that will be automatically assigned to new users.

Initially, your organization will be provided with defined maximum and minimum values for various characteristics that can be configured for each plan. These characteristics are referred to as quotas.

List of configurable characteristics and quotas for your organization:

- **Execution Microcredits**
    
    A 1 platform credit equals 1 million microcredits. Depending on the minimum execution fee (see corresponding section), users may spend less than 1 credit per scenario execution.
    
- **Plug&Play Microtokens**
    
    1 token equals 1 million microtokens. Used for Plug&Play nodes (e.g., AI nodes without connection setup), as well as for some integrations.
    
- **Active Scenarios Limit**
- **Parallel Executions Limit**
- **Min Execution Charging Period (Microseconds)**
    
    1 second equals 1 million microseconds. By default, 1 credit (1 million microcredits) is charged for every 30 seconds of scenario execution. You can reduce the charging interval. For example, setting it to ‚Äú3000000‚Äù will charge 0.1 credit (or 100,000 microcredits) every 3 seconds of execution.
    
- **AI Assistant Requests Limit**
- **Connected Accounts Limit**
- **Minimum Trigger Interval (Seconds)**
- **Execution History Availability Period (Minutes)**
